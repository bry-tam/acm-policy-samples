This example shows how to update/manage the cluster proxy and root CA.

Many times this is included as part of the cluster-install but will likely need to be updated over the course of a cluster lifetime.

You should replace the root-CA with your specific company requirements.

When updating the CA, it is advised to keep the old so there is an overlap where both the old and new will be trusted.
