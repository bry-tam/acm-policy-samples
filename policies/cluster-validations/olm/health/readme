These health policies will detect issue referenced in https://access.redhat.com/articles/7000167

Note they would also likely trigger on any operator bundle unpacking job failure as decribed in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/6459071.  These will not resolve the issue, will only highlight as failed in ACM when the jobs enter a failure state.

To use add similar to the PolicyGenerator config.
