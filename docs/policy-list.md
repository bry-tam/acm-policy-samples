## ACM Configuration
  | Policy                                                                            | Description   |
  |--------                                                                           |-------------  |
  | [ACM Observability](../policies/acm-configs/observability/)                       | Configures ACM Observability with ODF Storage. |
  | [Ensure Placement Tolerations](../policies/acm-configs/ensure-placement-toleration/) | Ensures all `Placement`s have proper tolerations configured. |
  | [Feature Flag Placements](../policies/acm-configs/feature-flags-placement/)       | Creates `Placements` based on naming convention to allow PolicyGenerator to specify a `Placement` that doesn't exist.  Naming creates a placement with the label specification determined by the name format. |
  | [Klusterlet Infa NodeSelector](../policies/acm-configs/klusterlet-infra/)         | Moves ACM components deployed on `ManagedClusters` to infra nodes if the clusters have infra nodes that don't include any other role labels. |
  | [kubeadmin Config CA Trust](../policies/acm-configs/kubeadmin-config-trustca/)    | Updates the kubeadmin secret for `ManagedClusters` to include the CA from the Global Cluster Proxy.  This way when the api cert is updated to a corporate certificate ACM maintains trust. |
  | [Managed ServiceAccount](../policies/acm-configs/managedserviceaccount/)          | Enables the ManagedServiceAccount component is enabled. |
  | [Policy Alerts](../policies/acm-configs/policy-alerts/)                           | Creates an example `PrometheusRule` to create an Alert for every Policy that is not compliant. |
