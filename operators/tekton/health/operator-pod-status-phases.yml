# The phase of a Pod is a simple, high-level summary of where the Pod is in its lifecycle. 
# The conditions array, the reason and message fields, and the individual container status arrays contain more detail about the pod's status. 
# There are five possible phase values:
#   Pending: The pod has been accepted by the Kubernetes system, but one or more of the container images has not been created. 
#            This includes time before being scheduled as well as time spent downloading images over the network, which could take a while. 
#   Running: The pod has been bound to a node, and all of the containers have been created. At least one container is still running, 
#            or is in the process of starting or restarting. 
#   Succeeded: All containers in the pod have terminated in success, and will not be restarted. 
#   Failed: All containers in the pod have terminated, and at least one container has terminated in failure. 
#           The container either exited with non-zero status or was terminated by the system. 
#   Unknown: For some reason the state of the pod could not be obtained, typically due to an error in communicating with the host of the pod.
