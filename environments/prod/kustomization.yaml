  ## Add the ClusterSet that should be managed as part of this environment.  This patch will update the placments and ManagedClusterSetbinding

      ## there should be no reason to inject enviroment info to the placement since
      ## the clusterset would control what clusters the policy is deployed to
      ## If you need this aditional level of control, uncomment the below.
